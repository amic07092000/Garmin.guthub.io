	Whether you’re leisurely playing with friends on your favorite local course or teeing up on that amazing resort course you’ve always wanted to play, Approach S20 knows where you are — and how far you are from the next pin. The watch’s high-sensitivity GPS receiver gives you the distance data you need to fire away with confidence. On the high-resolution display, you’ll see distances to the front, back and middle of the green, as well as hazards, doglegs and layups. You can also measure yardages for shots played from anywhere on the course.
